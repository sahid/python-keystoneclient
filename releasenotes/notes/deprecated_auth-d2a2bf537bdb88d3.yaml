    Several modules related to authentication in keystoneclient have been
    deprecated in favor of [`keystoneauth <https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/>`_]
    These modules include: ``keystoneclient.session``, ``keystoneclient.adapter``,
    ``keystoneclient.httpclient``, ``keystoneclient.auth.base``,
    ``keystoneclient.auth.cli``, ``keystoneclient.auth.conf``,
    ``keystoneclient.auth.identity.base``, and ``keystoneclient.auth.token_endpoint``.
    Tips for migrating to `keystoneauth` have been
    [`documented <https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/migrating.html>`_].
