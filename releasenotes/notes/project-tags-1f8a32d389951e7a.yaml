    [`blueprint project-tags <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/project-tags>`_]
    The keystoneclient now supports project tags feature in keystone.  This
    allows operators to use the client to associate tags to a project,
    retrieve tags associated with a project, delete tags associated with a
    project, and filter projects based on tags.
