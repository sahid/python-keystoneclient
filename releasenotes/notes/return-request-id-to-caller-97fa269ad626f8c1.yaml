    [`blueprint return-request-id-to-caller
    <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+spec/return-request-id-to-caller>`_]
    Instantiating client with ``include_metadata=True`` will cause manager response to return data
    along with request_ids for better tracing. Refer [`using-api-v3
    <https://docs.openstack.org/python-keystoneclient/latest/using-api-v3.html#getting-metadata-responses>`_]


    Added support to return "x-openstack-request-id" header in request_ids attribute if
    ``include_metadata=True``. Also, for APIs which return response as None, client will return request_ids
    as well if ``include_metadata`` is True.
